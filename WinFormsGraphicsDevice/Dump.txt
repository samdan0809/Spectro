- Should I make the model node classes aware of full spectral nature of the program?
    - If not, then who eles maintains that information.
        - 
    - I think teh answer should be yes, coz it's gonna get unintuitive and hairy otherwise.
- If the model classes are aware of the full spectral nature, then why would it not be ok for them to make the calls to
  calculate colors etc?
- Maybe I should store the model-world transform matrix instead of storing the vector, might save some runtime calculations.
- READ UP ON THE BASIC MATRICES AGAIN!!!!!
